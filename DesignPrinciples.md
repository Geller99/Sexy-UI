##  Sexy-UI Design Principles 


```


- Accessibility: components should be written to follow Ally-11 or AR-ARIA Guidelines for accessibility
- SSR-ready: All Sexy UI components must support server side rendering and be optimized for it
- No Focus Rings
- Favor state-based solutions over CSS Patterns
- Draggable Layouts
- Typescript based
- Built-in Media Queries
- Sexy-adaptable Designs (Need UI designer here)
