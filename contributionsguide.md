## Welcome to SexyUI's Contribution Guide

Thanks for choosing to build this project with us! Here's what this guide covers and how you can hit the ground running with ease.


- [ ] Code of Conduct 
- [ ] Git Contribution Workflow
- [ ] Code Style Guide
- [ ] Collaborating with our maintainers


**Getting Started**

- Take a look at our code of conduct (link) to understand how we keep this community approachable, respectable and inclusive to everyone!


``To get some insight on the project, head over to the (ReadMe) file and take a look.``

``Once you're done with that, let's get you started on the best Github workflow so you can get to contributing right away.``



## Git

Before you get started making delightful submissions, there are a few simple steps:

**Fork the repo (image)**

You need to ``fork`` the project repo to your github account to get started

Do this by navigating to the project's main page https://github.com/Geller99/Sexy-UI and clicking the ``fork`` button at the top-right corner of your screen, below the top nav-bar.

Once you click this button, there should be a copy of this project local to your github account.

You're ready for the next step! 


**Clone to your Local Computer (image)**

The next step is to grab a link from the project and use the ``git clone`` command to get a copy on your local machine

![Grab URL](https://github.com/YouGoDevs/Sexy-UI/blob/QA/assets/Screenshot%20(144).png)

In the command-line of your text editor or OS, enter the command
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Geller99/Sexy-UI.git

```

Once it's done cloning the repository, navigate to the ``directory`` containing the project using

```
cd Sexy-UI

```

Congrats! You now have a personal copy of the project on your local machine, let's discuss Branching next!


**Feature Branch - feature or fix branch** 
If you're completely new to the term branching, no worries! Take a look at this crash course! -> https://www.varonis.com/blog/git-branching


When you're looking to add an entire new component or make a significant change to a package, the best way to get started is by;

```
- Creating a new branch on your local computer
- Pushing it to the forked version of the project on your github
- Submitting your changes to SexyUI's official repository

```

git provides a few commands for implementing branching in your project;

```
git status -  this command checks the current branch and informs you of any recent file changes within that branch
```

```
git branch - returns the name of the current branch
```

```
git checkout -b "new branch" -  this creates a new branch and immediately switches you to it

```

When creating branches to submit for SexyUI, use the prefixes fix/branchName or feature/branchName to specify if your submission is a bug-fix or a new feature


**Coding and Committing**

When building your feature or fix, use easy to read commit messages and commit frequently for every distinct change.

We've provided a more extensive resource on building the best commit messages -  https://reflectoring.io/meaningful-commit-messages/



**Contributions Credit**

Every approved contributor appears on the insights of the project and is allowed to use SexyUI for a portfolio or resume reference


## How does a PR get merged? 

A PR gets merged after it has been reviewed by any of the team of devs 







## Code Style Guide

Once you're done preparing your repo for changes, we'd love to quickly examine the general guidelines and patterns around the codebase

The main idea is to have uniform components, containers, wrappers, styling conventions, stories and tests. 

Uniformity ensures maintainers can very easily reference changes and new contributors can easily add to a codebase without much confusion.



**Component Pattern**





**Contribution Process && Reviews**





**Predefined screen sizes in media queries**





**Nested media queries**
